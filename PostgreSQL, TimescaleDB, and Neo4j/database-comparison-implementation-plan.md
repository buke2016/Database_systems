# Database Comparison Implementation Plan

## 1. Implement schema in PostgreSQL and TimescaleDB

### PostgreSQL:
1. Install PostgreSQL if not already installed.
2. Create a new database for the project:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE financial_loans;
   ```
3. Connect to the database and execute the SQL statements provided in the normalized schema to create the tables.

### TimescaleDB:
1. Install TimescaleDB extension for PostgreSQL.
2. Create a new database and enable the TimescaleDB extension:
   ```sql
   CREATE DATABASE financial_loans_timescale;
   \c financial_loans_timescale
   CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS timescaledb;
   ```
3. Create the same tables as in PostgreSQL, but convert the `Loan_Applications` table to a hypertable:
   ```sql
   SELECT create_hypertable('Loan_Applications', 'application_date');
   ```

## 2. Design Neo4j graph model

1. Install Neo4j and create a new database.
2. Design the graph model:
   - Nodes:
     - Applicant
     - LoanApplication
     - LoanType
     - FinancialInformation
     - LoanDetail
     - ApprovalHistory
     - Document
   - Relationships:
     - (Applicant)-[:APPLIED_FOR]->(LoanApplication)
     - (LoanApplication)-[:OF_TYPE]->(LoanType)
     - (Applicant)-[:HAS_FINANCIAL_INFO]->(FinancialInformation)
     - (LoanApplication)-[:HAS_DETAIL]->(LoanDetail)
     - (LoanApplication)-[:HAS_APPROVAL]->(ApprovalHistory)
     - (LoanApplication)-[:HAS_DOCUMENT]->(Document)

3. Create Cypher statements to implement this model.

## 3. Develop increasingly complex queries

Create a set of queries with increasing complexity for each database:

1. Simple query: Retrieve all loan applications for a specific applicant.
2. Medium complexity: Find the average loan amount for each loan type, including only approved loans.
3. High complexity: Calculate the approval rate for each loan type, considering applicant's credit score and income.
4. Very high complexity: Identify potentially fraudulent applications based on multiple criteria (e.g., unusually high loan amounts, multiple applications in a short time frame, mismatched financial information).

Implement these queries for each database system.

## 4. Set up monitoring tools

1. Prometheus:
   - Install and configure Prometheus.
   - Set up exporters for PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB, and Neo4j to collect metrics.

2. HammerDB:
   - Install HammerDB.
   - Create test scripts for each database system based on the queries developed in step 3.

3. Apache JMeter:
   - Install Apache JMeter.
   - Create test plans for each database system, incorporating the queries from step 3.

## 5. Perform comparison tests

1. Define test scenarios:
   - Normal load: Simulate typical daily transaction volume.
   - Peak load: Simulate high-volume periods (e.g., end of financial year).
   - Stress load: Push the systems to their limits to identify breaking points.

2. Run tests using HammerDB and JMeter for each scenario on each database system.

3. Collect metrics using Prometheus:
   - Throughput: Transactions per second (TPS)
   - Latency: Response time for queries
   - Capacity: Data volume and growth over time
   - Concurrency: Number of simultaneous connections/transactions
   - Scalability: How metrics change as load increases

4. Analyze results:
   - Create visualizations (graphs, charts) to compare performance across databases.
   - Identify strengths and weaknesses of each database for different types of queries and load scenarios.
   - Evaluate how each database handles time-series data (especially relevant for TimescaleDB).
   - Assess the impact of the graph model in Neo4j for relationship-heavy queries.

5. Summarize findings:
   - Which database performs best for simple queries? Complex queries?
   - How does each database handle increasing load?
   - What are the scalability limitations of each system?
   - How does the performance of TimescaleDB compare to standard PostgreSQL for time-based queries?
   - In what scenarios does Neo4j's graph model provide significant advantages?

6. Provide recommendations:
   - Identify the best-suited database for different types of financial applications based on the test results.
   - Suggest potential optimizations or configurations that could improve performance for each database system.
